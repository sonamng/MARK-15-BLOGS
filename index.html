        <p>There are many advantages to teamwork, even though at <br>times it can feel a little stressful and messy. True teamwork can take<br> time to get going as working with fellow humans with different <br>personalities isn't always easy.</p>

        <img src="n.png"/>
        <p>But there's a reason that the common (if a bit worn-down)<br> phrase “two heads are better than one” has been around for ages.<br> Some of the best things simply cannot be done alone. Think of great<br> scientific discoveries, brave expeditions or the latest technology trends.<br> They have all required some pretty amazing teamwork!</p>

        <h2>1. Working together facilitates idea generation and creativity</h2>
        <p>There is no such thing as a new idea. It is impossible. We<br> simply take a lot of old ideas and put them into a sort <br>of mental kaleidoscope. We give them a turn and they make new <br>and curious combinations. We keep on turning<br> and making new combinations indefinitely,<br> but they are the same old pieces of<br> colored glass that have been in use through all the ages. </p>
        <p>You might not be too happy to hear this, but Mr. Twain is <br>right.There are no new ideas; there are only new ways to<br>recycle old ones. We consider them unique, but in fact, we draw <br>from a stock of existing concepts and copy, re-purpose, transform and <br>fuse them together. This depository of “old ideas” is called <br>collective intelligence  intelligence only possible through collaboration. <br>See, even in the metaphysical sense, teamwork is the key!?
            One important benefit of teamwork is,<br> therefore, the way thinking in a group influences<br> creativity. By involving multiple people (up to 10, <br>according to research). the number of different perspectives <br>can give birth to a greater number of <br>these combinations of ideas. </p>

        <h2>2. Teamwork improves productivity and brings better business results</h2>
        <img src="s.png"/>
        <p>Firstly, working in a team inspires people to work harder. Scientists<br> have found that team members actually motivate each other to be <br>more productive. We could explain this: surrounded by other people, <br>we feel a societal pressure to perform and deliver get things done. <br>A word or two on this matter from a well-known productivity expert, Carl Pullein:</p>

        <h2>3. Working in teams boosts employee morale and motivation</h2>
        <p>:

            When were feeling tired, our teammates can provide us with an extra<br> energy boost that we need to power through.
            Sharing success improves <br>team motivation while sharing failures makes the dark days <br>less gloomy and enables us to come up with solutions to <br>overcome them.
            As a part of a team, we have a greater level of control<br> over decisions and our work. This can lead to a greater feeling of <br>ownership of the project and overall recognition.
            <br>Working within a team adds to the feeling of belonging when<br> employees are a part of a communal goal, they feel more connected to the company and<br> thus more fulfilled and proud of their work. 
        
        The benefit of (well managed) <br>teamwork is a more rewarding work environment, which as a result<br> improves company loyalty, employee retention and lowersv turnover all positive things for any business.</p>

        <h2>4. Teamwork encourages taking healthy risks</h2>
        <p>During an extensive research project, Aristotle, Google's<br> People Operations department came to a number of interesting conclusions<br> about teamwork. The results made it clear: one of the main prerequisites for successful<br> teamwork was a "shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.</p>


        <h2>5. When we work together, we learn faster</h2>
        <p>Once you put together a team of people, there's a great chance it <br>will consist of people of different ages, backgrounds, skills, and experience. While<br> there are certain challenges at closing the gaps <br>between these differences, the richness of shared knowledge far surpasses it. This means a <br>continuous opportunity for people to learn from each other <br>professionally and personally.</p>

        <h2>6. Teamwork relieves stress</h2>

        <p>Were probably all tired of hearing about stress, how to become less <br>stressed and how to prevent it. Well, let us nevertheless add our 2 cents to the <br>debate by pointing out another benefit of teamwork stress relief.<br> It might not seem very obvious in fact, you could<br> swear that working with others is driving you insane!</p>
        <img src="str.png"/>
        <p>The benefit teamwork has in the arena of mental health also comes from<br> the fact that team members act as each other's relief team. Whenever you have to<br> pick up the kids from school, go to a dentist appointment, or <br>just need an hour of rest, your team can cover for <br>you. That results in a more flexible work schedule and a piece of<br> mind because your personal life did not disrupt that<br> important presentation.</p>

        <h2>7. Working together improves customer service</h2>
        <p>If your business relies on excellent customer service, <br>the advantage of teamwork can’t be missed. People tend to avoid companies<br> where employees are unhappy and this dissatisfaction is often <br>rooted in poor teamwork (see point 3 in this article). A team that's in sync will be more <br>welcoming and positive towards clients too.<br>
            Teams that have mastered collaboration and managed different<br> steps in handling the workplace silos, utilizecustomer requests better.<br> Why is that?
            Team members can share their experiences and best practices,<br> thus making the customer service better.
    When it comes to<br> solving problems, teamwork pays of in terms of a <br>plethora of solutions a team provides.A single person might never come up <br>with a certain solution that another co-worker comes up with.
    The service the customer<br> receives will be more consistent because <br>team members communicate and are on the same page regarding the company goals<br> and values.
    The service the customer receives will be more consistent because<br> team members communicate and are on the same page regarding the company goals <br>and values.
    With customer service being an extremely time sensitive business,<br> fast responses are of the essence. A group of people can speed up the process of<br> getting back to the customer, making it more efficient.</p>
